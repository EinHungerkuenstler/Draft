## Part I: Units

### SI Base Units

- Length - meter ($m$)
  
- Time - second ($s$)
  
- Amount of substance - mole ($mol$)
  
- Electric current - ampere ($A$)
  
- Temperature - kelvin ($K$)
  
- Luminous intensity - candela ($cd$)
  
- Mass - kilogram ($kg$)

#### Examples

1. What are the SI base units for charge?

    **Solution:**

    <details>
    <summary>click to view the solution</summary>

    $$
    I = nqsv
    $$

    I is the current, n is the number of electrons, q is the charge of an electron, s is the cross-sectional area of the wire, and v is the drift velocity of the electrons.

    Therefore, we could express the SI base units for charge as:

    $$
    C = mol \times C \times m^2 \times \frac{m}{s}
    $$

2. Use your knowledge of units to suggest a formula for repulsive force between two charged objects... the Force should depend on the Charge on each object ($Q_1 \text{ and } Q_2$), the distance between them ($r$), and a constant ($k = 9 × 10° J•m/C'$)

    **Solution:**

    Coulomb's law states that:

    $$
    F = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}
    $$

    therefore,

    $$
    F = \frac{N \cdot m^2}{C^2} \times C \times C \times \frac{1}{m^2}
    $$

3. Which of these equstions cannot be true?

    A. Energy $=$ Force $\times$ Distance

    B. Energy $=$ Frequency$^2$ $\times$ mass

    C. Energy stored on a capacitor $=$ Charge $\times$ Voltage

    D. Distance $=$ speed $\times$ time $+$ initial velocity

    **Solution:**
